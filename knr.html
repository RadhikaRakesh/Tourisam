            <p><h5> Parassinikadavu Snake Park</h5>
                Regarded as one of the finest snake sanctuaries of Asia,
                 the Parassinikadavu Snake Park is the pride of the south.
                  It is one of the most prominent reptile preservation centres 
                  in the country and is the only one in Kerala. The Parassinikadavu 
                  Snake Park is home to over 150 different species of reptiles like
                   crocodiles, monitor lizards and snakes- both venomous and non-venomous.
                    Not only reptiles and amphibians, but this snake park also goes a long
                     way to preserve and protect many wild mammals, marine creatures 
                     as well as rare avifauna- both endemic and migratory.

    <h5>Dharmadom Island</h5>
    
    
    Located about 100 m away from the pristine shores of Dharmadom Beach,
     Dharmadom Island has turned into favourite for tourists seeking a secluded 
     and tranquil picnic spot. This uninhabited island is covered with a canopy 
     of coconut palms and dense bushes, surrounded by mainland rivers on three 
     sides and the sea on the other. One can approach it only at low tide,
      and strolls around the place give one a brilliant view of the confluence 
      of the Anjarakandy and Thalassery Rivers.
