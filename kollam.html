       <h5>Jadayu Para</h5>
        For the best of Kollam sightseeing , this is a very recent construction,
         the Jatayu Nature Park is a rock-themed park. The adventure park has 6D
          theatre an audio-visual digital room, cable car and much more. This is
           built to promote mythology and adventure tourism. This giant bird 
           statue located on a hill top is certainly unique and something that 
           shouldnâ€™t be missed.
